# Full_Stack_Tech_Degree_Project_4

I am aiming for exceeds expectations and only want to receive this grade.

This project created a browser-based, word guessing gamecalled "Phrase Hunter.
JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming was used to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
A series of hearts will show the number of incorrect guesses and the number of remaining lives.


Stater files were given to start the project, from which the JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming was added to.  
Several changes where made to the CSS to change the background colors for the win and lose screen, as well as the color of the selected letters.


The CSS changes are shown below:
    :root {  --color-lose: #D94545;   }
    .chosen {   background: #7285e1;}
    .show {   background-color: #534ad5; }
    .wrong { background: #bb3b3b; }
    .lose { background-color: #ec4646; }
