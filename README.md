# Full_Stack_Tech_Degree_Project_4

* I am aiming for exceeds expectations and only want to receive this grade.

* This project created a browser-based, word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter.

* JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming was used to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
    - Code was included to allow the physical keyboard to be used as well.

* A series of hearts are used to show the number of incorrect guesses and the number of remaining lives.
  - These hearts are updated based on incorrect or correct guesses. 


* Starter files were given to start the project, from which the JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming was added to.  

* Several changes where made to the CSS to change the background colors for the win and lose screen, as well as the color of the selected letters.
-   The CSS changes are shown below:
        :root {  --color-lose: #D94545;   }
        .chosen {   background: #7285e1;}
        .show {   background-color: #534ad5; }
        .wrong { background: #bb3b3b; }
        .lose { background-color: #ec4646; }
